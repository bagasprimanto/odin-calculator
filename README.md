# The Calculator App

In this project I built a calculator app. Your regular old calculator, but in a single web page!

Try it yourself! Hopefully it mimics a calculator as well as it should!

## What I Learned
In this project I learned the following:
1. Used JavaScript to add event listeners to buttons
2. Used JavaScript to dynamically and neatly format and display data
3. Used HTML and CSS to layout and style elements on the screen
4. Used CSS Flexbox to neatly lay out elements on the screen
